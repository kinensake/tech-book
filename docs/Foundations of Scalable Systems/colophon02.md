# Colophon

The animal on the cover of *Foundations of Scalable Systems* is a dusky grouper (*Epinephelus marginatus*), also known as the yellowbelly rock cod or yellowbelly grouper. It is common in the Mediterranean Sea, and its range stretches from the Iberian Peninsula along the coast of Africa to Mozambique and from Brazil to northern Argentina. Dusky groupers are normally found in rocky marine areas from the surface down to a depth of about 300 meters. They are ambush feeders, hiding among the rocks and then sucking in prey and swallowing it whole.

Like other groupers, they have large, oval bodies and wide mouths with protruding lower jaws. Dusky groupers have dark reddish-brown or grayish heads with yellow bellies and pale blotches on the head and body. They can reach up to five feet long and can weigh over a hundred pounds. All dusky groupers begin adult life as females and begin to breed at around five years of age, but they develop into males between their ninth and sixteenth years. They live up to 50 years in the wild.

The dusky grouper is a popular food fish, leading it to become a victim of overfishing. Although conservation efforts are being taken, the species is classified as vulnerable. Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.
