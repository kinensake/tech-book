# Part IV. Event and Stream Processing

[Part IV](#part_iv) switches gears and describes architectures and technologies for processing streaming events at scale. Event-based systems pose their own unique challenges. They require technologies for reliably and efficiently capturing and persisting high-volume event streams. You also need tools to support calculating partial results from the most recent snapshots of the event stream (think trending topics in Twitter), with real-time capabilities and tolerance of processing node failures. I’ll explain the architectural approaches required and illustrate solutions using the widely deployed Apache Kafka and Flink open source technologies.
