# Part II. Scalable Systems

The five chapters in [PartÂ II](#part_ii) of this book focus on scaling request processing. The major topics covered include scaling out systems across multiple compute resources, load balancing, distributed caching, asynchronous messaging, and microservice-based architectures. I introduce the basic concepts of these architectural approaches and illustrate them with examples from widely used distributed technologies such as RabbitMQ and Google App Engine.
