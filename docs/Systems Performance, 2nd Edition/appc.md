# Appendix C

bpftrace One-Liners

This appendix contains some handy bpftrace one-liners. Apart from being useful in themselves, they can help you learn bpftrace, one line at a time. Most of these were included in previous chapters. Many may not work right away: They may depend on the presence of certain tracepoints or functions, or on a specific kernel version or configuration.

See [Chapter 15](ch15.md), [Section 15.2](ch15.md), for an introduction to bpftrace.
